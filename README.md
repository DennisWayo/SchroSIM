# SchroSIM

**SchroSIM** is a SchrÃ¶dinger-inspired, scalable, and hardware-agnostic simulator for quantum photonic circuits. Built in Swift and optimized for Appleâ€™s Metal framework, SchroSIM supports both continuous-variable (CV) and non-Gaussian quantum operations, offering a modular architecture suitable for education, research, and photonic hardware prototyping.


### ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- **Language**: Swift + SwiftUI + Metal
- **Simulator Types**: Gaussian (symplectic formalism) and Non-Gaussian (Fock/tensor-based)
- **Platform Support**: macOS (M1/M2), future WebGPU-ready
- **GUI**: Drag-and-drop photonic circuit builder
- **Compiler**: Intermediate Representation (IR) for hardware-agnostic mapping
- **Backends**: CPU and GPU accelerated simulation
